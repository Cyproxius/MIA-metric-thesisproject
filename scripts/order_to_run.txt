The order to run the scripts is as follows (some scripts might need to be modified based on the experiment output):
- padding_pythia_2_8b.sh (If the results aren't significantly different from the ones obtained with cut-off, go forward with threshold=0 in other experiments)\
- grid_search_pythia_6_9b.sh and grid_search_pythia_12b.sh (use optimal parameters in running evaluation experiments)
- evaluate_pythia_6_9b.sh and evaluate_pythia_12b.sh
